    <h1>Judging a Book by its Title...</h1>

    <br>
    <p>We all love fantasy books. Right? The profound characters, rich worldbuilding, and a seemingly endless supply of creativity.
      Or maybe not. This idea was inspired by a segment on a gameshow they cleverly titled "A title of words" where contestants
      were supplied a word bank of nouns and confronted with the trope of titles blank of blank. Like Game of Thrones or Lord of the 
      Rings or Well of Ascension (for all my Brandon Sanderson fans). After the segment had finished and everyone moved on I couldn't
      help but let my mind wander, just how many titles were like this. As I combed through my own personal library the dots started 
      to connect, more tropes emerging from the shelves. With this knowledge of title trends and the desire to uncover more oddities
      in my favorite passtime I set out on a quest to answer the question, is it ok to judge a book by it's title?
    </p>
    <p>I embarked on this journey with the help of the Goodreads API, a wonderful source of all things nerdy books that provided
      a list of books and their information on the scale that I had hoped. I was able to collect roughly 15,000 Fantasy and Sci-Fi
      titles to do analysis on, and after some extensive cleaning and data organization I had a dataset rich with interesting 
      trends and unique quirks.
