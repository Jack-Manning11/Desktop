            <p>We've all heard the common phrase of "Don't judge a book by it's cover" but nobody has ever said not to judge a 
                book by it's title! I'm here to take a deep dive into two particular genres to see if there is any creativity left
                in the book naming world. As a lover of sci-fi and fantasy books I've read quite a few, and now that they are growing 
                in popularity more eyes than every are on this genre. With the two largest fantasy fandoms in the world, Game of
                Thrones and Lord of the Rings, releasing brand new shows I started to see a pattern of behavior. Both of these titles 
                are in the format _____ of _____, and their new shows, Rings of Power and House of Dragons are also no exception. With 
                this discovery, and a list of 20 titles I could think of off the top of my head that also fell into this trope, I began
                my epic quest to find all of the common categories of fantasy books and go where noone has every gone before! Judging a 
                book by it's title.</p>
            <p>First I needed data, any good data story does, so I went to find the largest sample of book data that I could find, and I 
                ended up with the GoodReads API. This dataset gave me everything I needed and more, so I started the process of cleaning 
                and compiling it into something that was workable, cutting it down based on genre, creating new columns to aid in analysis,
                and removing anything that wasn't in english. I was left with around 14,500 fantasy books spanning across multiple decades
                and here is what I found.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
