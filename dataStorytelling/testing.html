            <h1>Judging a Book by it's Title...</h1>
            <h2>A data visualization story by Jack Manning</h2>
            <p>We all know the adage "Don't judge a book by it's cover" but nobody has said anything about judging one by it's 
                title. I am a self proclaimed lover of all things Sci-Fi and Fantasy, but with that comes a nerdy obsession for
                the details, and I found an interesting connection when browsing through some Fantasy series. I started to realize
                that an awful lot of Fantasy titles were following some predictable behaviors, and I wanted to see how widespread
                it was, so I begain this quest. Let's peruse the shelves of Fantasy novels and try to solve the mystery of title 
                creativity.
            </p>
            <p>In my analysis I found quite a few categories that contained enough books to be worth talking about. Each of these
                categories are mutually exclusive (no book is a part of two categories) and the analysis is done on around 15,000
                of the top rated Sci-Fi and Fantasy books according to the GoodReads API. The categories are as follows, Blank of
                Blank, Blank and Blank, One word, "The" One Word, and The Adjective Noun.
