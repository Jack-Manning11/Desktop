        <h1>Mechanical Keyboards</h1>
        <p id="name">Website Made by Jack Manning</p>
        <p id="name2">Mechanical keyboards work using 3 main components, a keycap, a switch, and a PCB to translate those sweet clicky sounds into digital signals that your computer can understand. This page will walk you through how each of those subsystems work together to give you a greater understanding of mechanical keyboards as a whole.</p>

                <p>Switches are the pivotal element of mechanical keyboards, determining factors such as actuation force, tactile feedback, and audible click. There are various types of switches available each with unique characteristics tailored to different user preferences. These switches contain metal contacts that connect when a key is pressed, completing the circuit and sending the corresponding signal to the computer.</p>

                <p>The Printed Circuit Board (PCB) serves as the backbone of the mechanical keyboard, connecting the switches and transmitting signals to the computer. It houses the electrical components and pathways that facilitate communication between the keys and the computer, ensuring accurate input recognition. PCBs can also feature customizable lighting effects and programmable macros, enhancing the keyboard's functionality and aesthetics.</p>
