    <p> My goal for this course is to be able to code and edit an ongoing personal website that can act as my resume.</p>
    <p> I am a third year CTD major from the east coast and new to front end development. In my free time I'm mostly a nerd,
        playing Magic the Gathering and D&D but I also love the outdoors and playing music.
