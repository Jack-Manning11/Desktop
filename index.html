<head> Jack Manning He/Him</head>
<body>
  <p> My goal for this course is to be able to code and edit an ongoing personal website that can act as my resume.</p>
  <p> I am a third year CTD major from the east coast and new to front end development. In my free time I'm mostly a nerd,
    playing Magic the Gathering and D&D but I also love the outdoors and playing music.
