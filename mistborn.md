## Mistcloak
The mistcloak is an intricately made piece of clothing that consists of longs strands of thick fabric sewed together so that they flow freely, masking a Mistborn's flights through the air by making them sound like the wind. Something with a bonus to AC but it is very recognizable, as only true Mistborn have ever been known to don a mistcloak.

## Metallurgy
At first level you understand the basic metals and alloys, and have a good understanding of metals. You have the ability to craft (or buy) small vials of metal flakes suspended in liquid, each small vial holding 1 ounce of metals. You can also make large vials that hold any combination of 8 ounces of metals that require an action to consume. You can consume a vial as a bonus action, at which point those metals will be added to your pool, up to a cap. These metals last in your pool until you burn them, or have them stripped away through some other means. If you try to take a long rest with metals still in your system you will become poisoned for 24 hours and not gain the benefits of a long rest. 

## Burning
Each metal you consume has it's own unique abilities and Burn time. The burn time will tell you how quickly 1 ounce of that metal will last while activated. Some metals will be consumed extremely quickly while others may be able to be maintained for hours with ease. Most metals (with only a few exclusions) can be burned at multiple levels: weak(1), strong(2), and flared(5). These act as multipliers and, in conjuction with burn time, tell you how long you can have an ability and at what degree that ability will help you. 

For example, Tin is an extremely common metal with a slow burn time of 1 hour, you can have a weak burn of tin for an hour, a strong burn of tin for a stronger effect for half an hour, or flare your tin for 12 minutes. Pewter however is a bit rarer, and has a relatively quick burn time at 1 minute. This means a weak burn of pewter lasts a minute, a strong burn 30 seconds(5 rounds), or flared for 12 seconds (2 rounds). 

Beginning at first leve you can activate a weak allomantic ability as an bonus action but any level higher requires a full action. You can dismiss a metal at anytime as a free action or simply let them run out. If any of the metals require a DC the DC will be equal to 8 + proficiency bonus + WIS modifier unless specified otherwise.

### Zinc - 30 Mins

This is not mind control, just a nudge in a direction. Emotional Allomancy only works on creatures with an INT of 8 or more. Could have some interesting interactions with the Charmed or Frightened conditions.

**Weak:** Choose up to 10 targets within 30ft of you to nudge with a specific emotion. Everyone now has a +2 to checks regarding that emotion, Persuasion, Intimidation, Deception, or Animal Handling. If any of these creatures act too out of place (DM's discretion) a creature can make an INT check against your Allomantic Save DC to know if anyone is being manipulated.

### Copper - 2 Hours
Burning copper creates a Copper Cloud, shrouding you and those around you from magical means of tracking. This will only work on the standard methods of magical spying, an incredibly powerful being will be able to pierce your coppercloud with a strong enough effect. This is not an anti-magic field, spells that simply wish to do damage to you via line of sight will still work, this only prevents your magical detection.

**Weak:** While this metal is burning you create a sphere with a radius of 30ft in which magical tracking cannot work. Any spell 3rd level and below, or ability that is 5th level or below, has no affect.

**Strong:** While this metal is burning you create a sphere with a radius of 30ft in which magical tracking cannot work. Any spell 5th level and below, or ability that is 10th level or below, has no affect.

**Flare:** While this metal is burning you create a sphere with a radius of 30ft in which magical tracking cannot work. Any spell apart from Wish has no effect in this sphere. 

### Bronze - 1 Hour
Bronze allows a Mistborn to sense magical pulses around them, each one thrumming with a specific beat. When you sense something you are able to make an Arcana check to try and learn more about the source of the sound. The general location is known to you and if you have 10 or more, you learn the school of magic, 15 or more, you learn it's general purpose, and 20 or more, you know the exact spell. This can also work as a metal detector for magic items.

**Weak:** While this metal is burning you create a sphere with radius of 15ft around you, sensing any magical pulses. You have a +2 to your Arcana checks.

**Strong:** While this metal is burning you create a sphere with radius of 15ft around you, sensing any magical pulses. You have a +4 to your Arcana checks.

**Flare:** While this metal is burning you create a sphere with radius of 15ft around you, sensing any magical pulses. You have advantage on your Arcana checks.

## Higher Metals
These metals are a bit rarer, their alloys being more difficult to come by and don't burn for as long. However they all hold valuable information despite burning only at 1 level.
### Gold - 5 minutes
Gold reveals your past self had you made different chocies, or had your situation been different. An ethereal shadow reveals itself to you and only you, and you are able to understand your shadow and how it feels.

**Burning:** While burning this metal you can see through the eyes of your shadow, understanding the life they went through and by extension your own. You have advantage on all Insight, Arcana, and History checks you make regarding yourself.

### Electrum - 5 minutes
Electrum reveals your own future, sprouting shadows from yourself with a number of possible futures. It also acts as a counter to Atium.

**Burning:** While burning this metal you create a number of shadows equal to 2 x your proficiency bonus that play out the next 6 seconds if you were to take those specific actions. Interpreting these shadows requires immense concentration, so you must treat burning this metal as if you were concentrating on a spell. These shadows do not tell you what action to take, they simply reveal the consequences should you take an action. 

You can make an INT check to try and gain information on what the best course of action may be. The DC is set at DM's discretion, scaling depending on the situation, and on a successful check you are able to properly inform yourself on what the best course of action is.

### Bendalloy - 6 seconds
Bendalloy is an extremely potent metal, allowing you to create a sphere of compressed time. When you begin burning this metal choose a location within 15ft of you and a sphere with a radius of up to 15ft is created. Once the sphere is up time moves incredibly fast on the inside, you appear as a blur to anybody not present in the circle, and all sounds will be compressed into a millisecond when they exit the barrier. The sphere only creates the faintest of shimmers, but an extremely intelligent creature can make an Arcana check to try to notice it. Any ranged attacks that enter or leave the bubble are treated as critical misses as they ricochet wildly. Area of affect spells still hit in their area. 

**Burning:** While burning bendalloy everyone in the sphere gains an extra turn. If someone tries to leave the circle with the bubble still up they recieve a level of exhaustion and must make a DC 15 DEX saving throw or stumble and fall prone.

### Cadmium
Cadmium is bendalloy's opposite and instead creates a sphere of slowed down time, making the world around you seem a blur. While this metal is often thought of as useless there can be very creative use cases. When you begin burning this metal choose a location within 15ft of you and a sphere with a radius of up to 15ft is created. Once the sphere is up time moves incredibly slow on the inside, everything outside appears as a blur to anybody in the circle, and all sounds are drawn out as they enter the barrier, making them unintelligble. The sphere only creates the faintest of shimmers, but an extremely intelligent creature can make an Arcana check to try to notice it. Any ranged attacks that enter or leave the bubble are treated as critical misses as they ricochet wildly. Area of affect spells still hit in their area. 

**Burning:** While burning cadmium everyone in the sphere "loses" a turn, being skipped in iniative order every other time. If someone tries to leave the circle with the bubble still up they recieve a level of exhaustion and must make a DC 15 DEX saving throw or stumble and fall prone.

### Chromium
Chromium burners are known as Leecher's, gaining the ability to drain another's magical affects with just a touch. For allomancers this involves draining their metal supply but this can apply to many forms of magic. 

**Burning:** When burning this metal any time you make contact with someone, either through a touch or attack (melee weapons?), you are able to drain somebody's magic. You can use your reaction to smother someone's magic ability, acting as a melee range counterspell. Any physical touch you make on a creature prevents them from using magic until the start of your next turn. 

Another idea is to have it consume spell slots...

### Nicrosil
Nicrosil is an extremely interesting metal, one barely understood by those who use it. You gain the ability to burn Investiture, allowing another to gain a massive boost of power from whatever they are doing. 

**Burning:** When burning this metal you can touch another creature to embue them with a burst of power. You do not choose the power that is boosted, instead using your resource to increase another's ability. This will upcast any spell by 2 levels, or if the target is another allomancer, cause their existing metal to be flared in a white hot burst, expending their entire metal supply in a blast of power.
### Aluminum
Aluminum is an interesting metal, one widely considered pretty useless.

**Burning:** Burning aluminum wipes out all of your metal stores, emptying your body of any allomantic metals.

### Duralumin
Duralumin is an enhancement metal, one that must be burned in combination with another metal. This combination causes whatever metal(s) that are burning to be greatly enhanced, increasing their power in a singular burst.

**Burning:** When you burn duralumin any other metals that are stored are instantly consumed, draining them entirely for a burst of power. Whatever other metal(s) you are burning at the time will cause the corresponding affects to take place:
*Iron:* You pull with incredible power, ripping things towards you in a wild burst. You are able to pull on any number of sources of metal within 100ft, yanking them towards you with incredible power, your damage increases to 2d8 and you are able to pull on metal in someone's body and aluminum.
*Steel:* You push in a burst of power, launching things away from you with raw power. Your damage die increases to 2d8 and there is no limit on the amount of things you can push on. You gain the ability to affect and detect metal in someone as well as aluminum. If you push off an anchor to fly your fly speed is doubled.
*Tin:* Burning duralumin with tin is often a bad idea, the incredible burst of sensory overload can risk knocking you unconcious if you don't have a way to dampen it's strength. You will have a momentary burst of understanding, seeing or hearing with your range being doubled before knocking yourself out as every sound becomes deafening and every light source becomes blinding.
*Pewter:* Burning pewter and duralumin ignites that fire inside you, pushing your body to limits you never thought imaginable. During the burst you have double your movespeed, a +5 to melee attacks, +5 to AC, cleanse your body from any negative conditions and heal 2 of your damage die instantly. You have advantage on all STR checks as well. After this duralumin burst you gain a level of exhaustion.
*Zinc:* You pick an emotion and release a wave of raw power, that emotion becoming all the targets feel. You can affect any number of creatures in a 60ft radius, empowering them with that single emotion. Creatures have advantage on the check to know they are being manipulated but will take the course of action that makes the most sense based on the emotion. Worry may cause people to flee, despair causing people to give up, hope inspiring them to join your cause, or anger to insite a riot.
*Brass:* You pick an emotion and remove it entirely from the targets, leaving that part of their emotions empty. You can affect any number of creatures in a 60ft radius. Creatures have advantage on the check to know they are being manipulated but will take the course of action that makes the most sense based on the emotion chosen. Sootheing away anger might make a creature docile, hope may make them surrender, confidence may make them flee, etc.
*Copper:* ...?
*Bronze:* ...?
