          <h2>Javacsript Fighting Game</h2>
          <p>This is my javascript portion of the final assignment for Web. It is a 2 player fighting game coded from scratch meant to mimic old fashioned arcade games. Find a friend and take each other on in the mystical forest, good luck! Control
          the Knight with WASD and use Spacebar to attack and control the Huntress with your Arrow Keys, using the Down Arrow to Attack. Click the image below to play!</p>

        <p>This project was meant to show some of my knowledge on object orientation and Javascript as a coding language. The game is all hand coded and customized to give a polished feel to the movement and physics.
          It has built in gravity, a double-jump limiter, as well as numerous different sprite animations for all of the relevant motions the characters would go through. The health bars are dynamically created and I'm
          super happy with the overall result!
