          <h2>Colorado Symphony Poster Mailer</h2>
          <p>A poster mailer created with the use of Illistrator and InDesign as a way to show off laying out long swathes of text in a professional and stylized way. I chose to go with a clean, geometric design for the front, and used an interlocking system of paragraphs to display the important text on the back.</p>

        <p>I was prompted to create a poster design for the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, a piece of literature made to be mailed out to interested parties and provide them with all of the key information to that year in Orchestra. The front cover was designed and mocked up in Illistrator, creating an eye-catching piece that still fit the
          theme of classical music. The back side was then created in InDesign, using custom paragraph templates to display all of the information in a more interesting and easily digestible manner. The entire poster is made to then be folded up into eighths and mailed out using the bottom left corner of the poster side as a mailing envelope.
